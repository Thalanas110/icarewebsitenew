# Environment Variables for Netlify Deployment

This file contains the environment variables you need to set in your Netlify deployment.

## Required Environment Variables

### Supabase Configuration
Set these in your Netlify site settings under "Environment variables":

```
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
VITE_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
```

## How to Set Environment Variables in Netlify

1. Go to your Netlify dashboard
2. Select your site
3. Go to "Site settings" → "Environment variables"
4. Click "Add variable" for each environment variable
5. Enter the key and value pairs listed above

## Getting Supabase Credentials

1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard
2. Click on "Settings" → "API"
3. Copy the following values:
   - **Project URL** → Use as `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`
   - **Project API keys** → **anon/public** → Use as `VITE_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`

## Security Notes

- Never commit actual environment variable values to your repository
- The `VITE_` prefix makes these variables available to your frontend code
- Only use the **anon/public** key for the publishable key, not the service role key
- Make sure your Supabase Row Level Security (RLS) policies are properly configured

## Local Development

For local development, create a `.env.local` file in your project root:

```
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
VITE_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
```

This file is already ignored by git (check your .gitignore file).
